But I might take question about some other things! I got some really got arguments out of this book and I’m ready for more, as long as they’re productive. Ask somebody where to find my Discord server if you’re interested. </p><h2>How to Use Golden Calibration </h2><p>You’ll build Solar characters in Golden Calibration just like you would under the standard rules. The only major rules change is that these Charms assume that project slots don’t exist, and since every Third Edition supplement since the core has made the exact same assumption, you’ll find this book completely forwards-compatible. </p><p>There’s also one minor presentation change: if an upgrade Charm does nothing but upgrade or modify its prerequisite, I’ve listed it as an Expansion to save space instead of giving it a separate listing, possibly on a different page. Expansions work exactly like normal Charms (they cost the same amount of XP, etc.); they just have condensed write-ups. </p><h2>Design Principles </h2><p>Golden Calibration completely rewrites the text of the Exalted Third Edition Charmset, but you’ll find that many Charms haven’t changed in function even if they now have half as many words. (Layout also matters. Take a look at Heaven Thunder Hammer for an example of a Charm that becomes way less complicated when you turn the long explanation of how far you fly into a table.) Combat Abilities, in particular, saw a fairly light touch on the math. </p><p>Some Abilities, such as Athletics, have been broken up into multiple sections to separate different categories of Charms. I think you’ll find this makes them easier to page through while building a character. </p><p>As far as the great controversies of the edition go, if something is fine at what it does, but people are unhappy with the fact that it exists at all, I kept it; if something is bad at what it does and people are also unhappy about it, I changed or axed it. </p><p>In general, I tried to keep things consistent with the mechanical principles set forth in <strong>Exigents: Out of the Ashes</strong>, with one exception: I did not give any of the Solar training Charms the Training Keyword. Other than that, here is a short summary of things that saw major changes: </p><ul><li><p><strong>Awareness</strong> had a complicated structure dictating how when and how you could activate your super-senses, with special time rules and discounts for activating multiple senses at once. On the grounds that this is fiddly and boring, and that no super-senses guy in the relevant fiction has ever been caught without his super-vision turned on that I can remember, I completely tossed all this out and just made all the senses come online reflexively for the same cost. So far I have not seen any downside to this. </p></li><li><p><strong>Craft</strong> removes all of the references to project slots, and gives the big categories a helpful guide explaining why you’d buy each of the Charms in them. </p></li><li><p><strong>Investigation</strong> adds several additional Charms improving your ability to question and profile people, and providing benefits for having done so. </p></li><li><p><strong>Larceny</strong> had a lot of things moved around, partly because there were way too many Charms for basic sleight-of-hand, but mostly because I’ve been watching a lot of Lupin III. (Honestly, Investigation now has a lot more of Inspector Zenigata. With any luck, he’ll see more success in a context where he and his archenemy are both Solars.) </p></li><li><p><strong>Lore</strong> includes a rewritten Wyld-Shaping Technique based on the introduce fact mechanic (in fact, there are quite a few new Charms related to that mechanic), and introduces some major changes to the Essence-Lending Method tree. </p></li><li><p><strong>Occult</strong> has had people asking for sorcery-enhancing Charms for a long time, both dice tricks and otherwise, so I added them. The rest of the tree has also seen some major shakeups, for which I think we must blame Lois McMaster Bujold. • Performance has had its split-function Charms combined into a unified tree. </p></li><li><p><strong>Resistance</strong> saw some retuning (in particular, the main anti-hazard Charm now works against bonfires, the most common hazard of all), but the main change is that the bit of Dual Charms that works on withering attacks and the bit that works on decisive attacks is now distinct to the eye. I also decided that I was going to continue to buff the armor tree until I felt like someone would actually buy it. I’ll probably buff it again in the morning. </p></li><li><p><strong>Socialize</strong> is a lot shorter without the persona tree, but is still one of the game’s biggest Ability spreads. A lot of Socialize Charms tried to do some clever mechanical thing but didn’t really make it clear what they actually do in-fiction. I think you’ll find them easier to work with now. • Survival had several key Charms that weren’t really bad, but sounded bad because they focused on letting you perform adequately in miserable conditions but didn’t make you any better in decent conditions. I tossed a bit of glitter on them, and added a few farming Charms (Stardew Valley is popular, right?) and cleaned up the familiar tree. </p></li><li><p><strong>Thrown</strong> now has a Charm or two to help you deal withering damage by bypassing soak.</p></li></ul><p> This is nowhere near everything. I changed Charms; I added Charms; I deleted Charms. Frequently the name is the only thing a Charm has in common with the original, and even those have been massaged (it turns out a lot of weird Charms in the core were weird because they’d been massaged to fit a legacy Charm name). A few Charms from <strong>Miracles of the Solar Exalted</strong> were included in the revision; most were not. </p><p>Unlike my previous books, which were unapologetically designed to suit my way of doing things, this one is meant to be for everybody, so I held back on some of the mechanics that appeal to me, but would have irritated a bunch of other people. </p><p>One of the worst Charms in the game is now one of the best; please feel free to argue about which one that is! </p><h2>Disputes </h2><p>If there are any disputes at the table over how to interpret the mechanics in this book, the player who is subscribed to Jenna Moran’s Patreon at the highest level is considered to be correct.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"folder":"imQ2rFDReNRAogL4","sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"ZrSKVlQS9cW8KPIV":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"exaltedthird","systemVersion":"1.8.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1676839054054,"modifiedTime":1676839433655,"lastModifiedBy":"ZrSKVlQS9cW8KPIV"},"_id":"ztTuObfA4EgSSgRc"}],"scenes":[],"tables":[],"macros":[],"cards":[],"playlists":[],"folders":[{"name":"Golden
